- Fixed restoring Multipart FormData
- Fixed restoring content-type header value
- Changed architecture of how new windows are created. Added communication channel between main and renderer process to ask about initial data state.
- Reduced number of reads and writes to workspace state file (where currently opened requests data are stored)
- Settings changed in one window are now reflected in other windows.
- Delayed left hand side menu initialization time after the workspace is restored. It reduces initial load time.
- Workspace requests are now restored one-by-one instead of bulk.
