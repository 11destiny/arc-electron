You are welcome to contribute to the project. To start developing use following instructions.

I assume you have [Node.js][1] already installed on your machine.

git clone https://github.com/[your username]/arc-electron.git
```

If you're not planing to contribute (you will not send a pull request) you can clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-electron
```

When ready go to the directory:

```shell
cd arc-electron
```

Then install dependencies:

When all dependencies are installed run:

```shell

New application window is now opened.
