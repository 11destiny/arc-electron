# Things to do before the next release

-   Unified application search - single search bar instead of separate search bars in each list
-   themes-panel
-   Remove `anypoint` components and maintain single build
-   REST APIs - storing unresolved model and resolving it when rendering API console. This way it enables API editing (in the future)
